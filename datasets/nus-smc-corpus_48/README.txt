Welcome to the Sung and Spoken Corpus developed at Sound and Music Computing Laboratory at National University of Singapore.

The corpus is a 169-min collection of audio recordings of the sung and spoken lyrics of 48 (20 unique) English songs by 12 subjects and a complete set of transcriptions and duration annotations at the phone-level for all recordings of sung lyrics, comprising 25,474 phone instances.

The corpus consists of the following:

- Twelve folders of the 12 subjects.
- Each folder consists of “sing” and “read” folders, which consist of 4 sung and spoken .wav files. Sampling rate is 44.1kHz.
- These folders also contain the time-aligned phone-level manual annotations of these audio files in .txt files. These annotation files can be viewed along with the audio files in Audacity.
